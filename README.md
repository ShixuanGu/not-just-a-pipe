Shot on 35mm film near Harvard, this series revisits a forgotten icon of early computer vision — not as data, but as presence.

Once, the fire hydrant stood at the frontier of machine perception: a geometric constant, bold in form, universally recognizable. These red, yellow, rusted sentinels taught early models to see — not with imagination, but with recognition.

This project turns the lens around.

Wandering the streets by the Charles River, I photographed fire hydrants on 35mm film, embracing the slow cadence of analog. Each hydrant reveals its own posture, patina, and context — a quiet architecture shaped by both utility and neglect.

What was once a bounding box is now a portrait.

## 📷 Project Contents
- `README.md` – You’re reading it
- `/images/` – Digitized 35mm scans of 36 hydrants, in JPEG
- `/metadata/` – To be added after the second roll finds its way through the camera :)

## 💡 Why Hydrants?

Fire hydrants are among the most frequently labeled objects in early object detection datasets like COCO (category ID `11`) and Open Images (class `/m/01pns0`). (Do you know why early vision folks used hydrants for camera calibration?)  

With their bold shapes, fixed positions, and street-corner ubiquity, they offered the perfect subject for machine vision’s formative years — simple, reliable, and everywhere. Before deep networks turned to cats, faces, or dreams, the hydrant stood as a quiet constant.  

This project revisits that role — not as annotation, but as presence; not as data, but as infrastructure made visible.
